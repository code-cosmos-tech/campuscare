# Campus Care: A Full-Stack MERN Application

Welcome to **Campus Care**, a web application designed to help students connect with campus services like counseling, academic advising, and health check-ups. This project is a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application that manages user authentication, appointment scheduling, and emergency notifications through a secure and modern user interface.

This document provides all the necessary instructions to set up, run, and understand the entire project, including both the backend API and the frontend client.

## Getting Started

To get the full application running locally, you need to set up both the backend server and the frontend client.

### **Part 1: Backend Setup**

1.  **Clone the backend repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-backend-repository-url>
    cd <backend-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Backend Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the **backend** project and add the following:
    ```env
    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>

    # A strong, secret string for signing JWT tokens
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=yourSuperSecretKeyHere

    # Your Gmail account for sending emergency emails
    EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com

    # Your Gmail App Password
    EMAIL_PASS=yourgmailapppassword
    ```

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`. Keep this terminal open.

### **Part 2: Frontend Setup**

1.  **Clone the frontend repository in a new terminal:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-frontend-repository-url>
    cd <frontend-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API URL:**
    The API URL in the frontend is configured in `src/store/Auth.jsx`. Ensure it points to your running backend server. The default is already correct if your backend is running on port 8080.
    ```javascript
    // src/store/Auth.jsx
    const URL = "http://localhost:8080";
    ```

4.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` and connected to your local backend.
